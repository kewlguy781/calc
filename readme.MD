# Calcuator for Devpoint's assignment

##  Build a calculator using HTML and JavaScript

A user should be able to enter 2 numbers and click on an operator.
The result should be output on the screen.
You should prevent dividing by zero.
Style the calculator. (HINT: the grid system in your choice of CSS framework works really well for a calculator layout/or css grids)
Things to think about
a basic calculator equation has a leftHand value an operator value and a rightHand value
for example: 4 + 4
When writing your code make sure you have at least 1 leftHand value before letting the user click on an operator button
Before you can click on the equal button make sure you have a leftHand value an operator value and a rightHand value or else you don't have a valid equation!
Use innerText to get and set the text of the calculator "Screen" to show the user the equation and the result of the equation


## Bonus Objectives:

Work on unfinished challenges
Allow calculations to be added on to. e.g. 5 + 5 = 10 + 4 = 14
Show a history of calculations
Create a memory add and memory clear functionality.
Implement as many advanced calculator features as you have time for (eg. sin, cosin, power etc...)
